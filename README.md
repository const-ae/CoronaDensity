# CoronaDensity

My attempt to visualize the spatial distribution of the Corona outbreak in Germany.

Classical density maps with the number of cases often just reproduce the population density (for example at [tagesschau.de](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/coronavirus-karte-deutschland-101.html)).
However, better approaches are available: https://xkcd.com/1939/ shows the 2016 US election result where each person represents 250,000 votes.

I took the same approach for the Corona map, I **exaggerate** the number of Corona cases by **500x** so that one can see anything.
